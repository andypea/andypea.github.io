title: Types and Objects
---

Objects are usually used to serve two seperate roles:

  - The definition of new types.
  - The organisation of code, so that it can be found by developers (and the compiler?).
 
The conflation of these two roles can make code hard to understand and maintain.

We can seperate out these roles, by restricting the use of methods to those needed for defining a type
and then implement all other functions as free functions.

The language then needs some method which helps developers find free functions which operate on a given type.
This can be done using extension methods.

Functional Programming
Algebraic Data Types
State
Composition over Inheritance
