title: The New Zealand Housing Crisis
---

# Two Primary Causes of the Crisis

## Under-supply of housing

The rate of residential construction is less than the rate of immigration.

## Subsidy of Mortgages

The central bank prints money, keeping interests rates artificially low.
Every year, this is a hidden tax on people saving money and a subsidy for anyone with a mortgage.
This is exacerbated by the Basel II rules, which force banks to use there money for mortgage loans.

# Secondary Causes

## Voting Patterns

People who own property vote much more than people who don't.

## MPs Financial Interest

Most MPs own property and benefit from rising house prices.
Is this also true for the central bank governer and other unelected officials?
